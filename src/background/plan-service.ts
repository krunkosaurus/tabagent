/**
 * Plan-approval service.
 *
 * Mirrors PermissionService: when the agent proposes a plan, `requestApproval`
 * parks on a Promise until the panel resolves it via `resolve()` (approve /
 * reject). On SW restart the parked Promise is lost; the loop's
 * resumeIfInterrupted re-emits the plan so the user can still approve.
 *
 * Unlike the permission service, there's no grant store -- plan approval is
 * scoped to a single run (matched by runId in the session), so each new user
 * message requires a fresh plan.
